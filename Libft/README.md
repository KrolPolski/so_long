# Libft
This project duplicates many functions of the basic C libraries, with a focus on string maniplation and linked lists. This was the first project of my studies at Hive Helsinki, and these functions form a library that I can use in future projects. The purpose was to ensure I fully understood how a lot of the basic string and memory manipulation functions work.

It also now includes ft_printf (which duplicates the printf function) and get_next_line, which allows you to easily read a file using a file descriptor, one line at a time.
